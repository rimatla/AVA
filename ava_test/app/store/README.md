# Old-school

Not all applications use Redux ðŸ˜ž. I hacked together this (non-flux) Customers store
to pretty much demonstrate how you test dealing with updates that happen to your
components when they're updated from an external source of data (like a store).

I don't recommend you write your stores this way.

This store is tested, but there's not really much going on in here...
